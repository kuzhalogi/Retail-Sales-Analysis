#  Retail Store Sales Analysis (Power BI) 
*by Kuzhalogi Murthy* 
## Overview
The dataset contains 12,575 sales transactions but has **missing values, inconsistencies, and "dirty" data**, making it a great test case for **data cleaning & visualization**.

## Key Insights from Analysis
### **1. Seasonality & Sales Trends**
- **January consistently records the highest revenue** across all years.
- **December also performs well**, particularly in 2023 and 2024, likely due to holiday shopping.
- **2024 had the highest overall sales**, indicating growth in transactions or pricing strategies.

### **2. Category Performance**
- The **Butchers category leads in sales**, followed closely by **Electric Household Essentials and Beverages**.
- Butchers contribute **13.58%** to total sales, slightly outperforming other top categories like **Food, Furniture, and Beverages**.

### **3. Sales Channel Distribution**
- **Online purchases slightly surpass in-store transactions**, showing a preference for digital shopping.
- **Online purchases are mostly paid in cash**, followed by **credit card and then digital wallets**.

### **4. Impact of Discounts**
- **No discounts were applied in this dataset, meaning total revenue remains unaffected by discounts.**
- However, **a significant portion of purchases still had discounts**, suggesting that discounts were recorded but not influencing final revenue.

### **5. Customer & Product Insights**
- **Top 10 customers** include **Customer 24, 08, 05, 16, 13, 23, down to Customer 02**.
